    <p>
      Everybody knows the biggest fuss of making pizza is dealing with the
      dough. Whether you buy it from the store or make it homemade, the process
      of stretching without tearing and baking it to your liking can be an
      ordeal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, let us introduce you to a no-dough pizza hack that makes pizza night
      more accessible than ever. Plus, it’s one of our best new recipes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter: Bread and Butter Pizza. This recipe from fan-favorite Chef John
      turned heads last week. It may sound a bit confusing (no, it has nothing
      to do with bread and butter pickles), but this oven-baked creation is
      incredibly simple—and it’s nothing short of pure genius.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similar to a Detroit-style pizza, this pizza has the perfect textural
      contrast between the flavorful, crunchy crust and the soft, cheesy
      topping. It’s easy enough to whip up as an after-school snack, but filling
      enough to serve up for dinner. It also happens to be a delicious way to
      use up day-old bakery bread.
    </p>

    <p>
      In less than 30 minutes, you’ll have a hot and fresh slice ready to
      satisfy your pizza craving. Find out why Chef John calls this, “by far,
      the best no-dough pizza hack ever.”

    <h3>What Is Bread and Butter Pizza?</h3>
    <p>
      Bread and Butter Pizza uses slices of several-day-old bread (rather than
      uncooked dough) to create a uniquely crunchy crust. Typically, this method
      results in a sad excuse for a pizza slice, but this hack ensures you get a
      crave-worthy dish every time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The recipe starts with thick slices of bread (Italian or French) slathered
      in butter on both sides. The butter serves two purposes here: On the
      bottom, it will help create a super crispy crust as it melds with the
      parmesan cheese, and on the top, it will create a barrier between the
      bread and the pizza sauce to prevent sogginess.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Butter and Parmesan on the bottom of the bread caramelize to create a
      delightful crunch,” Chef John notes. “If there was ever a recipe where you
      want to use real, actual parmesan cheese, this is the one.”
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the easiest pizza you’ll ever make. Plus, the taste and texture
      are unbelievably close to Detroit-style pizza, so if you love that thick
      and crispy version, you’ve got to try this. Pair alongside a Ceasar salad
      for a complete, easy meal.

    <h3>How to Make Bread and Butter Pizza</h3>
    <p>
      Start with a simple baking hack for keeping parchment in place: Just make
      a few small dots of butter directly on the baking pan to help the paper
      stick. Parchment will give you the crispiest texture, although aluminum
      foil would work just fine as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Place six thick slices of bread on the baking pan, separating each piece a
      few inches apart. The next step (and the dish’s namesake) is to generously
      butter both sides of each slice. Grate a block of fresh Parmesan cheese
      over the top—not enough to pile up, but enough to cover the bread from
      crust to crust.
    </p>

    <p>
      After each slice is coated, gently press the cheese down to secure it,
      then flip the bread cheese side down. The cheese and butter will meld
      together and caramelize onto the bottom of the pan. With the cheese side
      down, spoon your favorite pizza sauce onto the opposite buttered side,
      smoothing it from edge to edge. Don’t be too heavy-handed—a little will go
      a long way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here’s a secret, essential step: before adding on the cheese topping,
      you’ll prebake the tomato-sauced slices. This will cause the sauce on top
      to caramelize slightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, load up each slice as you would a regular pizza crust, with fresh
      mozzarella (Chef John prefers to dice it first), a few slices of
      pepperoni, and your other favorite toppings. Bake until browned and melty,
      then move to a cooling rack so the bottom crust doesn’t get steamy in the
      pan. Finally, enjoy your hot, extra-crispy piece of buttery pizz
