    <h3>Our Most Popular Recipe Last Week Is a Garlic Butter Lover's Dream</h3>
    <p>
      Last week, our site's most popular recipe left us eagerly anticipating the
      arrival of sunshine and summer break. It has all the simplicity of a
      casserole but with the flavors of a shrimp scampi so succulent, it would
      make Bubba Gump proud.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Shrimp Scampi Bake is one of our favorite no-fuss summer dishes, and
      although it only calls for six ingredients, it’s bursting with garlic
      butter flavor in every bite.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as in a classic shrimp scampi, the combination of the butter sauce
      and fresh shrimp is simply irresistible, but this dish is set apart by the
      added depth of flavor that comes from baking the shrimp right in the
      sauce. As one Allrecipes member calls it, this is “hands down the easiest,
      fastest, and best way to make shrimp scampi.”
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s all about the ease with this summery feast, and the whole meal comes
      together in a snap. The ingredients meld together in the oven (keeping
      your cooktop clean!) to create a decadent sauce that coats every pasta
      noodle. Another Allrecipes user notes how seamlessly the dish comes
      together, commenting, “I started boiling water for pasta while I cleaned
      the shrimp. Everything was done at the same time.”

      This recipe nixes white wine (a usual component of the dish) but adds in
      Dijon mustard for a unique and flavorful twist. If you’re skeptical, take
      it from this Allrecipes user: “I was hesitant about the Dijon mustard vs.
      white wine, but it was delicious as it was.” Another reviewer raves, “Who
      knew mustard would be good in a scampi dish!”
    </p>

    <p>
      In just under 40 minutes, the perfectly-cooked shrimp dish is ready to
      feed a crowd of eight. Even though it’s quick and easy, the final dish
      feels sophisticated and refined plated over a bed of linguine. “This
      recipe couldn't be any easier to fix..a wonderful meal to prepare in a
      hurry but tasting like you worked long and hard!,” says one recipe
      reviewer.
    </p>

      Parsley finishes off the simple dinner with a pop of color and freshness.
      Sprinkle some toasted bread crumbs on top for a subtle crunch, or pair
      with some crusty bread to soak up every last drop of the decadent sauce.
    </p>

    <p>
      With over 2,000 reviews on the recipe page, there’s no doubt this dish is
      a fan favorite, and if you have yet to try it, you’re in for a treat.
      Sophisticated enough for a special occasion, but easy enough for a fast
      weeknight fix, this crowd-pleasing recipe is one to rely on all summer
      long.
